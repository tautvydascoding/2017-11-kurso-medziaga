        <p>On April 17, 2014, Pacquiao announced his intentions to join the Philippine Basketball Association as the playing coach of Kia Motors Basketball team, an incoming expansion team for the PBA's 2014–15 season[42][43][44] Though he can be the head coach of the incoming team, the league's commissioner, Atty. Chito Salud, clarified that all incoming players should join the PBA draft.[45] Pacquiao plays basketball as cross-training to keep himself in shape. He previously played in the semi-professional basketball league, Liga Pilipinas, for the MP-Gensan Warriors, a team that he also owns. He made his debut in the Smart-Liga Pilipinas Conference II in January 16, 2009.[46]

After the decision, he was criticized by others specifically online by netizens, saying that Pacquiao could not handle boxing together with basketball. Pacquiao said that even before he started boxing, he was also criticized that he can not be a world champion, but he proved them wrong, it served as a challenge for him and he dared his critics to wait until they see him step onto the court. 'It will serve as a challenge for me, they do not know what they are saying, before I have also experienced this before I started boxing, but I proved them wrong.', Pacquiao said.[47] On July 9, 2014, he submitted his application for the upcoming rookie draft to the commissioner's office. His camp also hopes that the board of governors "respect" his request to be not drafted until Kia's turn.[48][49]

Pacquiao also owns a team in the PBA Developmental League (PBA D-League), the MP Hotel Warriors, which debuted in the league's 2014–15 season. He was briefly a co-owner of the Pacquiao Powervit Pilipinas Aguilas (now known as Pilipinas MX3 Kings), an Asean Basketball League team.</p>
